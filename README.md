# LSB-STEGANOGRAPHY
This project integrates LSB steganography and hybrid cryptographic techniques to securely embed sensitive information within an image. LSB steganography conceals data in the least significant bits of image pixels, while hybrid cryptography encrypts the data for enhanced security, ensuring confidentiality of the embedded information.
